        </p>
        <p> Stream is another powerful concept introduced in Java 8 under <a target="_blank"
                                                                             href="http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=335">JSR-335</a>.
            A stream represents a sequence of values and supports different kind of operations on it. It sounds similar to
            collections and you may have a question like, what is the difference between collections and streams and why this is
            introduced when collections are already there? Below are the details to get the answer. </p>
        <p> Collections are dynamic in-memory data structures. It means, collections calculate the element memory before the element
            is part of the collection. The iterator is used to retrieve these elements in sequence from the collection (source of
            the data). Let see this with below example.
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
Integer[] intArray=new Integer[]{1,2,3,4,5};
List<Integer> intList=new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(intArray));
for(Integer value:intList){
	System.out.println(value);
}
</pre>
        In the above example, the loop is iterating the list in sequence and printing the values in console. The loop is written by
        us to iterate these values. This is called external iteration. </p> <p> Streams don't have a storage and designed for the
        lamda expressions. Streams are created from source. This source can be collections, arrays, a generated function, I/O
        channel and other data sources. Stream operations are pipelines. Pipeline means a sequence of aggregate operations. Java
        Stream support filter, map, reduce, find, match and sort aggregation operations. In a simple sentence, Streams are created
        from data sources (like collections ) and is used to execute the aggregate operations. Streams are defined in
        java.util.stream package of Java API. Let see an example how it works.
        <ol>
            <li>The Stream doesn't have a storage and uses the same data sources
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
Integer[] intArray=new Integer[]{1,2,3,4,5};
List<Integer> intList=new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(intArray));
intList.stream().forEach(value->System.out.println(value));
</pre>
            </li>
            <li> The Stream is created from a data source. Here data source is <i>intList</i> object. <a>intList.stream()</a> method
                will create a <a target="_blank"
                                 href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/index.html?java/util/stream/Stream.html">Stream</a>
                object. This object is used to perform the aggregate operations.
            </li>
            <li> I used <a>forEach()</a> method to iterate the values. With this, we are giving a control to Java API to iterate the
                elements by giving a functionality that needs to be executed while iterating. <a>forEach()</a> method is not
                specific to stream. This method is introduced for lambda expressions.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p> <h2><a id="uao">Using aggregate operations</a></h2>
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li><h5>Stream operations can be a terminal operation.</h5> Stream operations can be a terminal operation. In this case,
                the stream operation will return a primitive, object or void. As I explained in above example, forEach() method is a
                terminal operation. Once the operation is executed stream will get closed. See below example, which will count the
                number of elements.
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
Integer[] intArray=new Integer[]{1,2,3,4,5};
List<Integer> intList=new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(intArray));
Stream<Integer> intStream=intList.stream();
long count=intStream.count();
System.out.println("Total elements - "+count);
</pre>
                Take another example which will print a message if the list contains even number.
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
Integer[] intArray=new Integer[]{1,2,3,4,5};
List<Integer> intList=new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(intArray));
Stream<Integer> intStream=intList.stream();
boolean containsEven=intStream.anyMatch(value->value%2==0);
System.out.println("Is list contains even ? - "+containsEven);
</pre>
                In above example <a>anyMatch()</a> is a terminal method which will take a condition as input and returns true if the
                condition is matching to any one value from the stream source. Once the terminal operation is executed on stream and
                if we call another operation again on the same stream will cause an exception.
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
Integer[] intArray=new Integer[]{1,2,3,4,5};
List<Integer> intList=new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(intArray));
Stream<Integer> intStream=intList.stream();
long count=intStream.count();
boolean containsEven=intStream.anyMatch(value->value%2==0);
System.out.println("Total elements - "+count);
System.out.println("Is list contains even ? - "+containsEven);
</pre>
                <i>intStream</i> get closed once the <i>count()</i> operation is called. Again we are calling <i>anyMatch()</i>
                method on closed <i>intStream</i>, it will throw java.lang.IllegalStateException exception.
            </li>
            <li><h5>Stream operations can be chained</h5> Chained stream operations produces a new stream. This stream will exist
                until we call a terminal operations.
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
Integer[] intArray=new Integer[]{1,2,3,4,5};
List<Integer> intList=new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(intArray));
Stream<Integer> intStream=intList.stream();
Stream<Integer> evenIntStream=intStream.filter(value->value%2==0);
System.out.print("Even numbers are - ");
evenIntStream.forEach(value->System.out.print(value+" \t"));
</pre>
                In above example <i>intStream</i> is a stream which holds data source values. <i>evenIntStream</i> stream is created
                from <i>filter()</i> operation. <i>filter()</i> operations filters the data source based on the condition that we
                pass. On <i>evenIntStream</i> I am calling <i>forEach</i> terminal operation. Once I call terminal operation the
                stream get close. We can write the same program as below.
                <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
Integer[] intArray=new Integer[]{1,2,3,4,5};
List<Integer> intList=new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(intArray));
Stream<Integer> intStream=intList.stream();
System.out.print("Even number are - ");
intStream.filter(value->value%2==0)
         .forEach(value->System.out.print(value+" \t"));

</pre>
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p> <h2><a id="ooe">Order of execution</a></h2>
        <p> Before using streams, we should know the order of pipeline operations execution. As I said before, Intermediate
            operation are not executed until we call terminal operations. This is called laziness and we saw this above
            examples. </p>
        <p> As a traditional Java programmer we know that when we call any method, caller will not get control until that method is
            executed completely. But this is not true with the streams. Let's take some example and see how the streams are
            executed.
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
 Integer[] intArray=new Integer[]{1,2,3,4,5};
List<Integer> intList=new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(intArray));
intList.stream()
       .filter(value->{
          System.out.println("Filter called for value - "+value);
          return value%2==0;	
       })
       .forEach(value->System.out.println("Even value - "+value));
</pre>
        </p> <p> A traditional Java programmer thinks that first the <i>filter()</i> method is executed completely and then for each
        is called. This is not true with streams. As I said, streams doesn't hold any values and iterates from the source. Due to
        this, the output of the program looks like this. </p>
        <pre class="prettyprint command" style="color:#fff">
Filter called for value - 1
Filter called for value - 2
Even value - 2
Filter called for value - 3
Filter called for value - 4
Even value - 4
Filter called for value - 5
</pre>
        <p> First stream will get the first value from the data source <i>intList</i> object and passes the value to <i>filter()</i>
            method. If the filter returns false, the stream will fetch another value from <i>intList</i> and passes again to filter.
            If the filter returns true the same value is passed to <i>forEach()</i> method. </p>
        <h2><a id="ps">Parallel Streams</a></h2>
        <p> Parallel Streams are another powerful feature to support parallel process on data source. You know that the modern
            processors are coming with multi cores, which enables us to process more than one task at a time. Parallel streams help
            us to iterate elements from data source and execute the aggregate operations in quick by executing them in parallel.
        <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
Integer[] intArray=new Integer[]{1,2,3,4,5};
List<Integer> intList=new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(intArray));
intList.parallelStream().forEach(value->System.out.print(value+"\t"));
</pre>
        </p> <p> The above example shows how to create a parallel stream and execute. Without streams if you want to execute this
        with extremal iteration, we need to use the multiple thread concept by considering thread safety (as you know most of the
        collections are not thread safe). </p>
