                    S3 (Simple Storage Service) is one of the core services provided by Amazon to store the information
                    in
                    AWS cloud. This information could be binary files, images, multimedia files, text file or any other
                    data. S3 looks like as a file or block storage but works differently. Before using this service
                    first we
                    need to understand few basic things that why not to use traditional approach to store the objects.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Before choosing any storage there are various points to considered. Mainly, scalability,
                    availability
                    and durability. As mentioned, Amazon S3 is a cloud storage. That means the size of the storage is
                    not
                    fixed and can scale till unlimited. Where traditional approach(file or block storage) has a fixed
                    size and need to increase the size.
                    Availability means "Can I access my data right now?" once it is stored. Amazon S3 promises 99.99%
                    of availability. Durability means "Will my data is available in future?". Amazon promises
                    99.999999999%
                    of durability. That means once you store the data in S3, the chances of loosing it is almost not
                    possible. For example if you store 10,000 files in S3, chances of loosing a file is every
                    10,000,000 years.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2><a id="key">Object Key</a></h2>
                <p>
                    The file which we store in Amazon S3 is called object. Each object size could be minimum 0 bytes to
                    maximum 5TB. Each object will have a name called object key. This key name length could be minimum 1
                    character to maximum size of 1024 bytes in unicode format. For example, if you store a log file in
                    S3
                    with the file name application.log then <i>application.log</i> is a key. Once we store an object in
                    S3, object can be accessed over internet with object key. Hence the S3 object can be accessed over
                    internet, the key name should follow with DNS name standards. Which means we can use the key name
                    with
                    slashes(/), backslashes(\), dots(.) and dashes(-).
                </p>

                <h2><a id="bucket">Bucket</a></h2>
                <p>
                    Imagine that if we have mix of different files, how we will organise? The first thing comes into our
                    mind is
                    create a separate folders and move each files into specific folders. Bucket is similar to folder. we
                    can
                    use bucket to group similar objects(files) into one place. we can store objects only in buckets. S3
                    doesn't have any default bucket. If we
                    want to upload any object into S3, first we need to create a bucket first. Please note that we can't
                    create bucket inside the bucket something like sub-folders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Bucket name follows with DNS standards and may have maximum 63 letters. The URL domain name starts
                    with your bucket name when we access the S3 object through internet. What it means? The name of the
                    bucket should be a unique across all AWS account through out world. Once you create a bucket think
                    twice to delete the bucket. Once you delete the bucket you may or may not get the same name.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2><a id="objecturl">Object URL</a></h2>
                <p>
                    As mentioned above sections, first we need to create a unique bucket and then we can upload objects.
                    To access these objects over internet, the URL format looks like below.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h1>http://&lt;bucket name&gt;.s3.amazonaws.com/&lt;object key&gt;</h1></p>
                <p>
                    For example, if you want to archive application logs into S3 and the bucket name is <b>techjira</b>
                    and uploaded object is application.log then the URL looks
                    like, http://techjira.s3.amazonaws.com/application.log. Let say - you have two applications and if
                    want to archive these logs in file systems, usually will store like below,
                </p>

                    </g>
                </svg>

                <p>
                    If you want to store the same structure in S3 then we need to use slashes(/) for each folder. In
                    this scenario, we will have two object and each object key looks like below.
                <ul>
                    <li>https://techjira.s3..amazonaws.com/logs/app1/application-010116.log</li>
                    <li>https://techjira.s3..amazonaws.com/logs/app2/application-010116.log</li>
                </ul>
                in above URL, logs/app1/application-010116.log and logs/app2/application-010116.log are object keys. For
                convenience purpose AWS console show the folder structure but actually there is no folder structure in
                S3.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you see, the domain holds the bucket name, hence the bucket name should be unique globally all
                    aws
                    accounts. When I started using S3 got bit incontinence that we can't create sub folders and every
                    time
                    I need to search a new bucket name when I need to create new. I saw lot of posts on internet asking
                    why not to use another notation to access the bucket over internet something like
                    https://s3.amazonaws.com/techjira/application.log or another way which fit for REST API. After that
                    I realised that there are number of reasons why Amazon use this notation. One of that is static web
                    hosting through S3. In static web hosting we will use S3 bucket act like as http server and in this
                    case we need to access bucket as domain.
