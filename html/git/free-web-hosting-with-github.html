        <p>
            What is the first thing comes into your mind when you want to explore something? The first thing we do is take out a
            smart phone from your pocket and search on the internet. Irrespective of business size, the easiest way to
            reach out to the customers is the internet. It’s not limited only for business. Internet is the primary channel to explain
            to others about your innovation and experience. Internet helps you to access the contents around the clock
            with cost effective and convenient way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Getting into the internet is very simple. Technically, what all you need is a domain and web pages. There are lots of
            internet domain providers in the market. I did my domain registration through <a target="_blank"
                                                                                             href="http://www.godaddy.com">godaddy</a>.
            You can choose the domain providers as you like. Choose the domain provider and register a domain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you register the domain you need web pages to reach your contents. These contents could be a plain text, images,
            music files, videos and etc. If you know the HTML, CSS and JavaScript you can design the web pages or else you can hire
            someone to design or get free web templates from the internet. Once your web page is ready, you need to seek for web
            hosting.
            Like domain name providers, there are lot of hosting providers in the market. The majority of the domain providers will
            provide hosting as well, but you need to pay money for that. Before choosing the web hosting providers, we need to see
            if they provide the infrastructure which suits for our web page. For example, if you are planning to have a business
            transaction or dynamic web pages you need the right software installed on your web hosting servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are planning to have a standard or static contents of your web pages and don’t need any special
            software (called static web hosting) there are lot providers who gives web hosting for cheaper price. For
            example, <a target="_blank" href="https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/projects/host-static-website/">Amazon S3</a>
            static web hosting. Now, we don't need to spend any money for this. Yes, we can have a
            web hosting in Github without paying a single penny. This is very useful for the people who want to have a web site with
            static web pages like having company profile, business brochure, blog or personal profile. Use below steps to create a
            page
            in Github and map to your domain.
        </p>
        <h2><a id="create-page">Create a page in Github</a></h2>
        <p>
            The first step to host the web page in github is creating a page. Follow steps mentioned in github <a target="_blank"
                                                                                                                  href="https://pages.github.com/">
            page</a> to create a page.
            Don’t forget to create your repo with <i>.github.io</i> suffix. For example, if you want to create a repository
            something, like
            <i>techjira</i> then use name as <i>techjira.github.io</i>. if you don’t give this suffix, it will still work, but the
            default page
            will be rendered from <i>README.md</i> file. If you give a suffix, it will pick <i>index.html</i> as a default page.
        </p>
        <h2><a id="git-configure">Github configuration</a></h2>
        <p>
            There is a good documentation available in github with the instructions to use a custom URL with <a target="_blank"
                                                                                                              href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">Github
            pages</a>, but you need to go through multiple links to achieve this. Use below steps to add your domain into github.
            <ol>
                <li>Login into <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">Github</a>. Select your page repository from <i>
                    Your
                    repositories</i> list and click on <i>Settings</i>
        <p class="pageimage"><img src="web-hosting/git-repo-settings.png"></p>
        </li>

        <li>Scroll down until you see <i>Github pages</i>. If you already not yet enabled the page, select the branch to keep
            your web pages and click on the <i>Save</i> button.

        </li>
        <li>Once you have enabled the page option, give the domain name and click on the <i>Save</i> button. You will see a success
            message
            with your website name. The moment you save domain, <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> will
            add a file called a <i>CNAME</i> in your repository.
            <p class="pageimage"><img src="web-hosting/github-pages.png"></p>

            CNAME file looks like below
            <pre class="prettyprint linenums">
        www.techjira.com
    </pre>
        </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Once you are done with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/">Github</a> configuration go to DNS configuration.
        </p>

        <h2><a id="domain-configure">DNS configuration</a></h2>
        <p>
            To configure your domain with Github, you should know how to add DNS records with the DNS provider. If you don’t know how
            to do it,
            contact your domain provider. Most of the domain providers will have a web page to manage your DNS records online. Here,
            I am using <a
                target="_blank" href="http://www.godaddy.com">godaddy</a> DNS
            page to give the explanation. There are two different types of domains i.e., sub domain and apex domain. Sub domain
            usually
            comes
            with <i>www</i>. For example <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techjira.com">www.techjira.com</a> is a sub domain.
            Apex
            domain doesn’t have <i>www</i>. For example
            <a target="_blank" href="http://techjira.com">http://techjira.com</a> is an
            apex domain. DNS configuration is different for sub domains and apex.

        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>First login into DNS provider website and go to DNS setting</li>
            <li>Remove all the entries if you have any. Make sure you don’t have <i>A</i> records or <i>CNAME</i> records</li>
            <li>If you are using sub domain(WWW) add an entry of <i>CNAME</i> with value as <i>YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io</i>.
                for example, if
                you have a github user as “test” and then the entry should be test.gitgub.io
            </li>
            <li>If you have apex domain, then add an entry of <i>A</i> with the IP address of <i>192.30.252.153</i> or <i>192.30.252.154</i>
            </li>
            <li>If you have both sub domain and apex, then you need both entries. Sample records look like below with godady provider
                <p class="pageimage"><img src="web-hosting/godady-dns-setting.png"></p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's all. You are done with your hosting. Once your configuration is done, access your website from a browser. Please note
            that some DNS providers will take up to 1 day to refresh your records. If you want to verify the configuration is done
            correctly or not not use below steps to verify.</p>
        <h2><a id="verify-config">Verify configuration</a></h2>
        <p>
            You can verify the configuration  in using multiple ways. One easiest way is checking online. Go to online
            <a target="_blank" href="https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/">dig</a> tool and click on <i>A</i> OR <i>CNAME</i> to
            verify your records. It should be something like below.
        </p>
        <p class="pageimage"><img src="web-hosting/dig-cname.png"></p>
        <h2><a id="custom-error">Custom error page</a></h2>
        <p> If you would like to create your own custom error page HTTP error 404, create 404.html file in root folder of your page
            repository</p>
        <h2><a id="comments">Comment</a></h2>
