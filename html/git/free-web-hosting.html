        <p>
            What is the first thing coming into your mind when you want to explore something? The first thing we do is take out a
            smart phone from your pocket and search in internet. Internet is primary thing for every. Internet users are grown
            drastically in past couple of users. If you search for “internet users” in google, you will find out surprising results.
            For any business irrespective of their
            size the easiest way to reach out to the customers is internet. It’s not limited only for business. Internet is the
            primary channel
            to explain to others about your innovation and experience. Internet helps you to access the contents around the clock
            with cost effective and convenient way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Getting into internet is very simple. Technically, what all you need is a domain and webpages. Domain is a unique name
            to reach your webpages like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techjira.com">www.techjira.com</a>. There are a lot of
            internet domain providers in market. I did my domain
            registration through <a target="_blank" href="http://www.godaddy.com">www.godaddy.com</a>. You can choose the domain
            providers as you wish. Choose the domain provider and
            register a domain.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you register the domain you need a web pages to reach your contents. These contents could be a plain text, images,
            music files, videos etc. If you know the HTML, CSS and JavaScript you can design the web pages or else you can hire
            someone to design or get free web templates from internet. After designing the web pages, you need to link these files
            to your domain. You can’t link this files until unless you have a public IP server. We need to keep these webpages into
            public IP system and link to domain. This is called hosting. Like domain name providers, there are a lot of hosting
            providers in the market. Majority of thee domain providers will provider hosting as well but you need to pay money for
            these. Before choosing the web hosting providers, we need to see if they provide the infrastructure which suits for our
            web page. For example, if you are planning to have a business transaction or dynamic web pages you need right software
            installed in your web hosting servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you are planning to have a standard or static contents in you web pages and don’t need any special
            softwares(basically called static web hosting) we can choose free web hosting providers like Github. Yes, we can have a
            web hosting in Github without paying a single penny. This is very useful for the people who want to have a web site with
            static web pages like having company profile, business brochure or personal profiles. Use below steps to create a page
            in Github and map to your domain.
        </p>
        <h2><a id="create-page">Create a Page in Github</a></h2>
        <p>
            Creating a page in Githib is a first step to you to host your files. Follow Steps mentioned in <a target="_blank"
                                                                                                              href="https://pages.github.com/">
            page</a>.
            Don’t forget to create your repo with <i>.github.io</i> suffix. For example, if you want to create a repository
            something like
            <i>techjira</i> then use name as <i>techjira.github.io</i>. if you don’t give this suffix, it will still work but the
            default page
            will be rendered from <i>README.md</i> file. If you give a suffix, it will pick <i>index.html</i> as a default page.
        </p>
        <h2><a id="git-configure">configuration Github with custom domain</a></h2>
        <p>
            To map your custom domain, you should know how to add DNS records. If you don’t know how to do it, contact your domain
            provider. But most of the domain providers will have a web page to manage your DNS records. Here I am using <a
                target="_blank" href="http://www.godaddy.com">godaddy</a> DNS
            page to give the explanation. There is a good documentation avalable how to use custom URL with <a target="_blank"
                                                                                                               href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/">Github
            pages</a> but you need to go through multiple
            links to achieve this. There are two different type of domains i.e., sub domain and apex domain. Sub domain usually
            comes
            with <i>www</i>. For example <a target="_blank" href="http://www.techjira.com">www.techjira.com</a> is sub domain. Apex
            domain doesn’t have <i>www</i>. For example
            <a target="_blank" href="http://techjira.com">http://techjira.com</a> is a
            apex domain. DNS configuration is different for sub domains and apex. Before doing configuration first add your domain
            in github page.
        <ol>
            <li>Login into Gitgub and select the page from the repositories and click on Settings</li>
            <li>Scroll down until you see Github pages. If you already not yet enabled the pages, select the branch to keep your
                web pages. Most of the time its Master and click on Save button.
            </li>
            <li>Once you enabled the page option, give the domain name and click on Save button. You will see the success message
                with your website name. The moment you save domain, you will have a file called CNAME in your repository.
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Once you are done with Github configuration go to DNS configuration.</p>

        <h2><a id="domain-configure">Configure domain with DNS provider</a></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First login into DNS provider website and go to DNS setting</li>
            <li>Remove all the entries if you have any. Make sure you don’t have A records or CNAME records</li>
            <li>If you are using sub domain(WWW) add an entry of CNAME with value as YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io. for example, if
                you have a Github user as “test” and then the entry should be test.gitgub.io
            </li>
            <li>If you have apex domain, then add add entry of A with the IP address of 192.30.252.153 or 192.30.252.154.</li>
            <li>If you have both sub domain and apex then you need both entries</li>
            <li>Once your configuration is done access your website for browser. Please note that some DNS providers will take upto
                1 day to refresh your records. If doesn’t work wait for some time and try again. Below are the steps to verify your
                configuration
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2><a id="verify-config">Verify configuration</a></h2>

        <p>
            You can verify the configuration you did using multiple ways. You can also check online. Go to
            https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/ and click on A OR CNAME to verify the records.
