        <p>
            World Wide Web (WWW) is a very hot channel for any business. The present trend is getting business on web presence.
            Getting a business on web presence is very simple - create an awesome customer face web application and deploy it on
            server.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just image by spending some time and effort you build an awesome website which is very user friendly, simple to use and
            everyone likes it. People have started talking about your site in blogs, magazines and started sharing to their friends
            through social media and other channels. Now, your website is popular and your business started growing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your business is growing because you have a web presence as you followed the trend. To make your business web presence
            you need some infrastructure to support your web application. Let's assume, initially you deployed your website on below
            architecture.
        </p>
        <p class="pageimage"><img src="common_system.png"></p>
        <p>
            An HTTP server is a web server which will take the HTTP request and pass it to App server. App Server is an application
            server which contains your application.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's start the discussion with some example. Assume the app server can take maximum 500 TPS (Transactions Per Second).
            That means your application can process 500 requests in a second.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Note</b> - TPS depends on various parameters like server physical configuration (Memory, Processor, Network and etc.)
            and application architecture.
        </p>

        <p>
            As we assumed earlier, your business is growing in internet and number of users are increasing. That means the load on
            your server is increasing. At some point of time 500 TPS is not sufficient to serve all user requests. you need to look
            back on server configuration and need to scale your server configuration (vertical scaling). Even if you increase the
            server configuration, if the load on the server is keep on increasing again at some point of time your single server is
            not sufficient to serve all the request. In this case we need to add another server.
        </p>

        <p>
            Irrespective of assumption there are various reasons to have more than one server with application deployed in each.
            Below are the main reasons.
        <ol>
            <li>
                As we discussed above, we need to add more servers to handle more requests
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's assume your server is managing all the request on time and there is not much load on the server. Due to
                technical reasons or hardware failure your server went down. Until you make server up you can't do business over the
                internet. In this case you need a backup server (also called failover server).
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>


        <p>
            Overall, we should have more than one server to do business online. As we discussed, the HTTP server is the one who
            interacts with application server based on the request. Now we need to answer on below questions.
        <ol>
            <li>
                How the HTTP server knows how many app servers are there with application deployed or how to configure multiple
                application servers in HTTP server?
            </li>
            <li>
                What base HTTP server will route the request to application servers?
            </li>
            <li>
                How to configure failover servers?
            </li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, we will get the answers to all above questions by the end of this article.
        </p>

        <h2><a id="whatislb">What is Load balancing? </a></h2>
        <p>
            Load balancing is a technique used to distribute the application requests across the servers. Load balancer uses
            different kind of algorithms to route the request.
        </p>

        <p>
            Till now we are taking about load balancing on web application. Load balancing is not limited to web application. We can
            use this concept in multiple places. For example,
        <ol>
            <li>DNS load balancing</li>
            <li>HTTP load balancing</li>
            <li>SSL load balancing</li>
            <li>Network load balancing</li>
            <li>Database load balancing</li>
            <li>Cloud load balancing</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <p>
            This article is aimed to discuss on web application load balancing. See below diagram to understand the load balancing.
        </p>
        <p class="pageimage"><img src="lb.png"></p>
        <p>
            In above diagram I replaced the web server name with Load balancer. See <a href="#typesoflb">Type of Load balancer </a>section
            to know why the server name is changed to load balancer. Cluster mean a group of servers . <b>App Server1</b> and <b>App
            Server2</b> are the application servers which they are in one group or cluster to serve for the same purpose.
        </p>
        <h3>What does load balancer do</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Route the request</b> - Load balancer works as a reverse proxy to distribute the application traffic across the
            servers based on the chosen algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Health check</b> - Gets the health statistics of each server. This check is done based on the time frame. If the
            server is down due various reasons, the load balancer will not send the request to that server. Once the server is up
            again requests will be routed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Session stickiness</b> - Maintains the session stickiness. The load balancer will keep track of the previous
            requests. For example, if user U1 is severed through server A, all the U1 user requests will be served from server A.
            Session stickiness is optional. You can enable or disable this based on need. The load balancer will maintains the
            session stickiness using the client IP address, cookies or URL. Session stickiness may disturb the load balancing
            algorithm.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Failover servers</b> - We can maintain the list reserved servers or backup servers. The load balancer will maintains
            the list of backup servers and route the requests to backup servers if none of the primary servers are available to
            serve the request.
        </p>
        <h2><a id="tolb">Types of Load balancers</a></h2>
        <p>
            Load balancer can be a physical device or a software. Based on need you need to choose the one. You can google to know
            about load balancer devices. <a href="https://f5.com/" target="_blank">F5</a> BIG-IP load balancer is widely used. F5
            supports load balance over multiple data centers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software based load balancers will work along with HTTP servers. Based on popularity below are the list of HTTP servers.
        <table class="section-table">
            <tr>
                <td>HTTP Server</td>
                <td>Comapany Name</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                <td>Google</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="http://news.netcraft.com" target="_blank">Netcraft</a> will conduct the surveys every month to understand the
            popularity of the web server. Visit their <a href="http://news.netcraft.com" target="_blank">site</a> to know the trend.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, we have device based as well as software based load balancers. Now the confusion is which one to choose. It's
            completely based on the business requirement. There is an article published by <a
                href="http://nginx.com/blog/five-reasons-use-software-load-balancer/" target="_blank">Nginx</a> which explains why
            to choose software based load balancer.
        </p>

        <h2><a id="hcrw">How to choose the right web server</a></h2>
        <p>
            Once you decide to go with load balancer making right choice to choose the one which are available in the market is the
            most challenging question. Here I am trying to give some guidance to understand the parameter that need to be considered
            to make your choice.

                Like OS uses process scheduling algorithms, load balancing also uses some algorithms or methods to balance the load
                in a group/cluster. Based on need we can specify the algorithm that need be used by load balancer. There are lot of
                algorithms to balance the load. Most commonly used algorithms are,
